# FortAI

FortAI is a Fortran-native AI runtime for model loading, execution planning,
sampling, and architecture-specialized accelerator backends.

The first delivery is a buildable Qwen3.5 CPU reference path. It contains the
public runtime types, GGUF Q8_0 loading, Qwen3.5 hybrid recurrent/full-attention
execution for the 0.8B, 2B, and 4B model family, native OpenMP/SIMD matvecs,
and persistent benchmark/provenance tooling. CUDA, Metal, MLX, HIP, SYCL,
Vulkan, and TinyGPU backends remain reserved for measured implementations.

## Design

FortAI keeps model semantics, state lifetime, and scheduling in Fortran. A
backend owns device-specific execution and kernel selection. The intended
compilation path is:

```text
GGUF metadata -> ModelIR -> PlanIR -> backend specialization
             -> packed weights -> validated execution plan
             -> measured kernel selection
```

The execution plan is bound before the token loop. The hot path will use
specialized calls with persistent state instead of rebuilding a generic graph
for every token.

The repository follows the Lazy Fortran conventions:

- independent CPU behavior is the correctness reference
- device implementations must report compiler and hardware provenance
- candidate kernels are accepted only after correctness checks
- transfer-inclusive and resident measurements are recorded separately
- unsupported backends fail explicitly and never fall back silently

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the staged implementation
plan.

## Build and test

Requirements are a Fortran 2018 compiler and [fpm](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/).

```bash
fpm build
fpm test
fpm run -- --version
```

For the native CPU candidate build:

```bash
tools/build_native.sh
benchmark/run_cpu_reference.sh

# model-level CPU smoke/benchmark
benchmark/run_qwen35_cpu.sh .provenance/downloads/qwen35-0.8b/Qwen3.5-0.8B-Q8_0.gguf
```

The local Lazy Fortran workflow is also supported:

```bash
fo
```

The model runner accepts a GGUF file, an initial Qwen tokenizer ID, a decode
step count, and a context limit. The persistent model fetch manifest is in
`.provenance/models.tsv`.

## Status

Version 0.1.0 includes an experimental model-level Qwen3.5 CPU runtime for
Q8_0 GGUF. Its behavior and throughput are benchmarked against llama.cpp by
persistent scripts, but it is not promoted for production until the named
workload performance gate is passed. CUDA and multi-GPU Qwen3.8-27B remain on
the roadmap. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

FortAI will only promote a production candidate for a named workload after it
matches or beats the fastest fair competing harness under the same conditions.
